          From the town of Nenmara in Palakkad district, the cloud-caressed
          peaks of the majestic Nelliyampathy Hill ranges are a sight to behold.
          The height of the hills ranges from 467 m to 1,572 m and it has an
          extremely calming effect on all who view it. To reach Nelliyampathy,
          one has to take the road starting from Nenmara that proceeds to the
          Pothundy Dam. There are about 10 hairpin bends that have to be
          negotiated on the way to Nelliyampathy. The Pothundy Dam is a
          beautiful locale with facilities for boating and is a nice option as a
          picnic place. As the Ghat road winds its way up to Nelliyampathy, at
          certain places there are viewpoints from where the vast stretches of
          Palakkad district are visible with its extensive paddy fields forming
          a verdant carpet. It also offers a splendid view of the Palakkad Gap,
          which is a geographical phenomenon in the Western Ghats formation in
          this region, bringing into view, parts of the adjoining State of Tamil
          Nadu. On the way up, those interested in bio farming can take a close
          look at the privately managed farms and also vast expanses of tea
          estates managed by different plantation companies. The hills of
          Nelliyampathy are also well known for their orange cultivation.
          Privately owned hotels and resorts are located at various points, as
          one goes up the hills of Nelliyampathy. The bio-farms located here are
          a major landmark as one proceeds up before reaching the topmost point
          at Palagapandi Estate. The estate has a quaint bungalow, built during
          the British rule in India, and has now been converted into a privately
          owned resort. At Kaikatty, a community hall is available, which is
          usually used as a base by those interested in trekking.

          While most parts of the Silent Valley are raw, wild, and devoid of
          human intervention, Attapadi Reserve Forest has remained a protected
          zone. The extensive mountain valley sits at an elevation of 2460 feet,

          the gigantic mountain peak of Malleswaram, which rises to almost 5460
          feet from the center of the valley, flanked by the Bhavani River and
          the Attapadi village. One of the less-explored forests of Kerala,

          Tipu's Fort, also known as Palakkad Fort, is a beautifully maintained
          edifice in Palakkad district and was an important military base in the
          past. Rebuilt by Hyder Ali in the 18th century, the fort was under the
          Mysore rulers until the British took control of the place. It was then
          used for providing government services during the British era. Named
          after Hyder's son Tipu Sultan, it is an important historical
          destination today. It is among the best preserved forts in South
          India. The thick laterite walls impress all who view it. People
          frequent the spot for relaxing walks and jogs. A large ground that
          lies between the Fort and the Palakkad town hall is an important
          location for public meetings and important functions. Today it is a
          protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India. It is a
          preferred picnic spot for everyone visiting Palakkad.

          for supplying drinking water to the city of Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu.
          The dam is surrounded by reserve forests. Muthikulam hill is situated
          on the eastern side of the dam. There is a natural waterfall in the
          hill. The waterfalls and the Dam are big tourist attractions. The
          famous 150-year-old Pattiyar Bungalow is on the banks of the Siruvani
          Reservoir. An agreement was executed in August 1973 between the state
          Governments for drinking water supply to Coimbatore town and
          neighbouring areas from the Siruvani Dam. The location being in the
          state of Kerala, the project was executed by the Kerala Public Works
          Department using the funds made available by the Tamil Nadu Government
